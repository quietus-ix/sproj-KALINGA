# KALINGA Web System
just a school project for the compliance of grades and peace to our sanity. This is a Humanitarian Aid Web App or simply put: A Donation Management System, particularly for the use of organizations handling humanitarian aid distribution. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

## How to use
- you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to use the TailwindCSS CLI build process
- I use VS Code to run the command `npm run dev` in its built-in terminal.
- Normally, you'd get an error about db_kalinga not being loaded. I use phpMyAdmin MySQL as my database interface so you might wanna import that in your phpMyAdmin. To do that:
  - Find the sql file inside `common/php` folder. It's called `db_kalinga.sql`
  - Go to your phpMyAdmin interface and create a database named after file above.
  - Import
