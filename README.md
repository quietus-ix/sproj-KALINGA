# KALINGA Web System
just a school project for the compliance of grades and peace to our sanity. This is a Humanitarian Aid Web App or simply put: A Donation Management System, particularly for the use of organizations handling humanitarian aid distribution. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

### Want to modify it?
- I used Tailwind CSS as my styling framework. If you're planning to use vanilla css, you don't have to do the instructions below. Else:
- you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to use the TailwindCSS CLI build process
- the npm command is inside the package.json file, under scripts. You just need to do `npm run dev` in the terminal to make your changes apply

### Where database
- under common/php folder

### frameworks/libraries used
- tailwindcss
- tailwindcss/daisyUI
- jquery
- alphinejs (too lazy to modify the codes where I used this library)
